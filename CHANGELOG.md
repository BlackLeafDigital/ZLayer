## [Unreleased]

### Added
- GPU inventory detection module (`zlayer-agent::gpu_detector`) that scans sysfs PCI devices for GPUs
  - Auto-detects vendor (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel) via PCI vendor IDs
  - Reads VRAM from PCI BAR regions, AMD `mem_info_vram_total`, or nvidia-smi
  - Reads GPU model names from DRM subsystem or nvidia-smi
  - Resolves device paths (`/dev/nvidiaN`, `/dev/dri/cardN`, `/dev/dri/renderDN`)
- GPU fields on `NodeResources` in scheduler placement: `gpu_total`, `gpu_used`, `gpu_models`, `gpu_memory_mb`, `gpu_vendor`, and `gpu_available()` helper
- `GpuInfoSummary` struct and `gpus` field on `NodeInfo` in Raft cluster state for distributed GPU awareness
- GPU detection runs at node init and node join, with results logged and displayed
